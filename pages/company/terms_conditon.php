                   <p> The Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall purchase the Goods in accordance with any written quotation of the Seller which is accepted by the Buyer, or any written order of the Buyer which is accepted by the Seller, subject in either case to these Conditions which shall govern the Contract to the exclusion of any other terms and conditions subject to which any such quotation is accepted or purported to be accepted, or any such order is made or purported to be made, by the Buyer.</p>

                   <p>The Seller’s employees or agents are not authorised to make any representations concerning the Goods unless confirmed by the Seller in Writing. In entering into the Contract, the Buyer acknowledges that it does not rely on, and waives any claim for breach of, any such representations that are not so confirmed.</p>
                   <p>
                    Any advice or recommendation given by the Seller or its employees or agents to the Buyer or its employees or agents as to the storage, application or use of the Goods which is not confirmed in Writing by the Seller is followed or acted upon entirely at the Buyer’s own risk, and accordingly the Seller shall not be liable for any such advice or recommendation which is not so confirmed.

                    <p class="tit-x mb-1"><span><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right color-x1 me-2"></i></span> Orders and specifications</p>
                 <p>The Buyer shall be responsible to the Seller for ensuring the accuracy of the terms of any order (including any applicable specification) submitted by the Buyer and for giving the Seller any necessary information relating to the Goods within a sufficient time to enable the Seller to perform the Contract in accordance with its terms.</p>

                 <p> No order which has been accepted by the Seller may be cancelled by the Buyer except with the agreement in Writing of the Seller and the Buyer shall indemnify the Seller in full against all loss (including loss of profit) costs (including the cost of all labour and materials used), damages, charges and expenses incurred by the Seller as a result of any cancellation. However, from the date of the order, a 14 day cooling off period will be allowed during which cancellations or reducing the order will be accepted by the seller without penalty. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, should the Buyer purport without the agreement in Writing of the Seller to cancel any order which has been accepted by the Seller or refuse to accept delivery of any of the Goods such action shall constitute a breach of the agreement and, at the option of the Seller, the Seller shall be entitled to require the Buyer to pay to the Seller by way of liquidated damages an amount equivalent to 50% of the invoice value of the order so purported to be cancelled or 50% of the invoice value of the Goods delivery of which is so refused (as the case may be). In the event of the Seller so requiring the Buyer shall pay such amount to the Seller (without any deduction) within 7 days of receiving from the Seller written notification of the amount required to be paid. The Seller and the Buyer hereby agree that such amount represents a genuine pre-estimate of the monetary value of the loss and damage likely to be suffered by the Seller as a result of such breach of agreement on the part of the Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the Seller opts to require the Buyer to pay liquidated damages as set out above, and the Buyer duly pays such liquidated damages, neither party shall have any further liability to the other in relation to the Goods in respect of which such liquidated damages are paid.</p>

                   <p> The price of the Goods shall be the Seller’s quoted price or, where no price has been quoted (or a quoted price is no longer valid), the price listed in the Seller’s published price list current at the date of acceptance of the order. Where the Goods are supplied for export from the United Kingdom, the Seller’s published export price list relating to the country of destination shall apply. All prices quoted are valid for 30 days only or such lesser period as shall be stated by the Seller on the face of the relevant quotation or until earlier acceptance by the Buyer, after which time they may be altered by the Seller without giving notice to the Buyer.</p>

                   <p> The Seller reserves the right by giving notice to the Buyer at any time before delivery to increase the price of the Goods to reflect any increase in the cost to the Seller which is due to any factor beyond the control of the Seller (such as, without limitation, any foreign exchange fluctuation, currency regulation, alteration of duties, significant increase in the costs of labour, materials or other costs of manufacture)or to any change in delivery dates, quantities or specifications for the Goods which is requested by the Buyer, or any delay caused by any instructions of the Buyer or failure of the Buyer to give the Seller adequate information or instructions.</p>

                  <p> Delivery of the Goods shall be made by the Buyer collecting the Goods at the Seller’s premises at any time after the Seller has notified the Buyer that the Goods are ready for collection or, if some other place for delivery is agreed by the Seller, by the Seller delivering the Goods to that place.</p>

                  <p> Any dates quoted for delivery of the Goods are approximate only and the Seller shall not be liable for any delay in delivery of the Goods howsoever caused. Time for delivery shall not be of the essence unless previously agreed by the Seller in writing. The Goods may be delivered by the Seller in advance of the quoted delivery date upon giving reasonable notice to the Buyer. The Seller shall be entitled to make part delivery of the Goods at any time.</p>

                  <p>If the Seller fails to deliver the Goods for any reason, other than any cause beyond the Seller’s reasonable control or the Buyer’s fault, and the Seller is accordingly liable to the Buyer, the Seller’s liability shall be limited to the excess (if any) of the cost to the Buyer (in the cheapest available market) of similar goods to replace those not delivered over the price of the Goods.</p>
